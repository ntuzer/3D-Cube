# Background / Overview
3D cube is a 3d Rubik's cube game.

Users can interact with a rotating 3d cube
and try to solve it by rotating the cubes faces.

# Functionality & MVP
Users will be able to:
  * Rotate the entire cube
  * Rotate the faces of the cube to alter the cubes
  * Generate a random cube
  * Solve the cube
The page will also include a set of instructions
and links to learn how to solve

# Wireframes

This app will be a single page with a simulation canvas,
and controls for manipulating the cube. Controls will
include buttons for randomizing the cube and buttons
for solving the cube.

# Architecture / Technologies
This project will use the following technologies:
  * Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure and game logic,
  * HTML5 Canvas for DOM manipulation and rendering,
  * Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

# Implementation Timeline

###  Over the weekend:
- [ ] Write proposal
- [ ] Set up repo

### Day 1:
- [ ] Set up files.
- [ ] Spend time learning html canvas and dom manipulation.
- [ ] Learn quaternion rotation.

### Day 2: Game logic
- [ ] Come up with game logic to track the cubes movements
- [ ] and change its state with user input.
- [ ] Write logic to track cube's front facing side.



### Day 3:
- [ ] Build out the cube and its sub components.

### Day 4:
- [ ] Style app and polish.


### Bonus features
 * Backend for persisting a user's progress on their cube.
